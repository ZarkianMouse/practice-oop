What is a value?
* a member of the set of possible interpretations of any possibly-infinite sequence of symbols
* the representation of some entity that can be manipulated by a program

What is an entity?
* an object that exists and is distinguishable from other objects
* abstract, not necessarily related to objects in OOP

What is an object?
* set of bits associated with the representation of values/entities in a computer

What is a type?
* a classification of data which tells the compiler or interpreter how the programmer intends to use the data
ex. Rank/Suit in a Card class

What is a narrowing conversion?
* Occurs when members of a larger set of values are grouped into a smaller set of values
ex. int to enum
may occur for the sake of preventing loss of information and/or providing clarity to the audience as to what the use of the data is
ex purpose. defining a set of enums for Rank/Suit to be used to create a Card class...

What is abstraction?
* the process by which programmers hide all but relevant data about an object in order to reduce complexity and increase efficiency

What does it mean to copy?
* the object and its copy have the same value, but they aren't the same thing
