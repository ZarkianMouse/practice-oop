An attempt to translate Adventureland from C to C++
Project for OOP

Necessary Components:
1. Separate implementation from declaration
2. Remove function definitions from main
3. Add commentary to program (the lack of such is confusing...)
4. Better selection menu
5. Add abstractions
   a. User
   b. Locations, items
   c. Enemy class?
6. General reorganization of code for better readability
